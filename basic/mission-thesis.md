# Mission
We want to create the best coworking space in Haarlem. We also want to create a startup hub and community of makers that achieve more together than they could alone. We want to reshape expectations about how entrepreuners and investors can work together. We want to create a comfortable and productive environment for founders, freelancers and makers. We want to create a safe place to learn, test ideas and ask for help. We want to create a community that people are proud of and consider precious. We want to have a strong network of vouched for, ambitous and experienced investors and business mentors who can help and enable our makers, founders, entrepreneurs to have the most positive impact possible. 

## Why
We believe that creating is a fulfilling and beneficial pursuit, and that being empowered to create, solve problems and improve our world in some way is both important and hard. We want to make it easier. We want to bring it within reach on the basis of merit alone.

## Why now
Because the internet has made it possible to learn and acquire skills. Because the internet has made it possible to deliver products at scale with low capital costs. Because remote working is becoming more common and the market for flex working spaces is growing. Because people need to come together and share the same space to inspire and encourage each other and to generate better ideas and solutions to hard problems.

## How
We start with a coworking space for makers. Not for corporates.
We blog about topics that are useful to our intended community.
We host events to bring our community together and create connections.
We build relationships with mentors so that we can connect them with mentors.
We reach out and filter experienced investors and mentors who benefit our
makers.

## What is special about us?
We have an office with unused desks
We have an office in a great location
We are experienced makers
We are entrepreneurs
We have experienced the problems we are trying to solve

## Why could this fail?
Revenue does not exceed costs
The number of makers who want to be part of this community is smaller than 30
The number of suitable mentors who want to mentor is smaller than 15
We suck at marketing, hosting events, blogging, running a corworking space.
Our day jobs take too much time
Our day jobs are more interesting

## What do you need to succeed? 
Interest from makers
Interest from mentors
Good attendance for the events
Some attention from the press
A viable working environment

## What metrics will you need to measure progress?
